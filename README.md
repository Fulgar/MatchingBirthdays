This project was completed as a bonus project for my Probability & Inference course @ Kennesaw State University during the Fall 2018 Semester. 

The project includes an implementation of Monte Carlo's Simulation algorithm in which the minimum number of people in a room needed for there to be a 50% probability that at least 3 and 4 people (independently) have the same birthday.

Also included, is the associated paper that was required to explain the logic behind the program.
